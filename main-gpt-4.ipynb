      "In our last session of the campaign, our party found themselves in the minotaur-populated town of Bodat, located in the desolate Fey Wastes. Governed by the mysterious Marquis, Bodat proved to be a dangerous place for our adventurers as they searched for their kidnapped brother, Bero, who may or may not be the reincarnation of the fallen god, Oberon. Their main objectives were to break into Hanta's compound, the notorious hub of the human slave trade in Bodat, in hopes of finding Bero and avoiding capture by the Minotaur police force. Additionally, the party sought to uncover the truth about their brother's identity and restore life to the once-vibrant Fey Wild.\n",

They successfully snuck into Hanta's compound and discovered a note suggesting that their brother had been recovered and the camp, possibly referring to Oggvay and Haemon's home, had been destroyed. The adventurers also had a curious encounter with a mysterious individual known as the \"Prince of all Cats,\" who seemed to hold influence over the Minotaurs. Moreover, they accidentally triggered a noisy Shujusreckus jukebox in the dining room, leading to a chaotic chase through the compound and an unexpected encounter with a minotaur.\n",

With each step, our party inched closer to unraveling the secrets of the Fey Wastes and rescuing their kidnapped brother, all while navigating the treacherous depths of Bodat and avoiding capture by the authorities.\n"
