campaign: In the desolate Fey Wastes, a stark contrast to the Fey Wild, desert tribe members embark on a quest to rescue a kidnapped brother. Joined by amnesiac guards from the ruined Seelie Court, they venture deeper into the mysteries of this barren land, aiming to both unveil its hidden truths and restore the once-vibrant Fey Wild.

adventure: In an unstable, alternate reality version of the Fey Wild, the adventurers seek the statues of the huntress and the mage, which hold the key to harnessing the scattered power of the Seelie Court.
