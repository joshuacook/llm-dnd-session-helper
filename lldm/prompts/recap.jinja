Topic: Recap Design for D&D Session

Let's begin. I need a ten-minute recap of our last session. 

Would you create a three-paragraph summary of the previous session
including campaign, adventure, player objectives, scenes, locations,
and NPCs?

IMPORTANT: Any DM objectives marked HIDDEN must not be revealed
nor mentioned at all in the recap. Anything marked as a secret to
players must not be revealed nor mentioned at all in the recap.
