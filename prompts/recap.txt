Topic: Recap Design for D&D Session


Here is the current campaign: {{campaign}}
Here is the current adventure: {{adventure}}
Here is the party: {{party}}

Let's begin. I need a ten-minute recap of our last session. 

Here are the player objectives from the previous session: {{player_objectives}}
Here are the scenes from the previous session: {{scenes}}
Here are the locations from the previous session: {{locations}}
Here are the NPCs from the previous session: {{npcs}}

Would you create a three-paragraph summary of the previous session including campaign, adventure,
player objectives, scenes, locations, and NPCs?
