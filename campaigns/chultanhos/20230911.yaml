recap: 'Our party, in the midst of their mission to rescue Bero, their kidnapped kin,
  from the clutches of human slave trader Hanta, remained nestled in the minotaur-dominated
  town of Bodat. Governed by the enigmatic Marquis, Bodat presented treacherous terrain
  for our fearless adventurers, Haemon, Oggvay, Spat, and Dev, who found themselves
  playing a dangerous game of evasion against both Minotaurs police force and Hanta''s
  Minotaur thugs. With a personal vendetta against those who destroyed their desert
  camp and an enigmatic directive from a coyote to learn to fly, their journey is
  far from over.


  Our crew found themselves lurking near the Whispering Basin, on the verge of making
  an entrance into the shrouded Kobold District. However, they chose instead to keep
  company with a local group of felines who claimed they knew a thing or two about
  navigating the tunnels in Bodat. The sly cats hinted at a shadowy figure known as
  the ''Prince of all Cats,'' who commands the ears of the Minotaur townsmen. Later,
  after maneuvering their way into Hanta''s compound successfully, our group stumbled
  upon a note, ''camp destroyed; child recovered.'' Once again, the grim reminder
  of the brutal attack they had survived, and the loss of their brother Bero echoed
  in their minds, fueling their resolve to confront the tormentors.


  Peeling back layers of mystery, our party''s exploration  inadvertently triggered
  a Shujusreckus jukebox in the dining area. The sudden cacophony sent them scampering
  across the compound, stealth no longer an option. As they sprinted desperately towards
  the vicinity of the slave pens, they inadvertently crossed paths with a Minotaur,
  leaving them in the awkward radius of his immediate attention. Will our adventurers
  manage to weather this storm stirred by their own hands? Only time will tell.'
